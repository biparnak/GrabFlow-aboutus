                An investment manager inherited an asset management business from a leading Pan-African
bank with a view of modernizing the operation and scaling. Our-Compnay was approached to offer
a cloud-based administration system which allowed clients, administrators and portfolio
managers to have a full view of their portfolio from a portal.

            <p>
              Capitalizing on many years of experience in the financial services sector, Our-Compnay
Associates offered an innovative end-to-end Investment Solution that utilized cloud-based
technology to provide a functionally rich and versatile platform that supports the Front, Middle
and Back Office requirements. That is, from trade execution, transaction processing, portfolio
management reporting, compliance, and performance measurement. In 2020, the business has
scaled considerably with minimal disruptions to operations. More so, they avoided downtime
when lockdowns were implemented in 2020 since administrators could work from anywhere.

                After succeeding in servicing its institutional client base, a business wanted to extend the

                Our-Compnay designed a system that allowed the Relationship managers to focus on their clients
rather than the administration processes. The solution allowed the manager to have a 360° view
for clients’ and funds’ investments monitoring. Clients have 24/7 access to their portfolio
investments through integrated web modules.
